# WebProject

A website for doctor consultations and appointments.  :calendar:

:dart:  My project for the ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni. (August 2021) 

### URL: https://medexproject.azurewebsites.net/

## :information_source: How It Works

- Guest visitors: 
  - browse all available doctors;
  - apply as a doctor or register as a patient;
  - read doctor profiles.
- Logged Users:
  - same as guest;
  - can apply as a doctor or register as a patient.
- Doctor (user role):
  - confirms/declines patients' appointments; 
  - edits their profile.
- Patient (user role):
  - can cancel appointments;
  - makes appointments with doctors;
  - makes online consultations with doctors;
  - rates doctors after appointments;
  - edits their profile.
- Admin:
  - creates/deletes towns and specializations; 
  - can review client feedback;
  - can validate applied doctors.

## :gear: Application Configurations

### 1. The Connection string 
is in `appsettings.json`. If you don't use SQLEXPRESS, you should replace `Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;` with `Server=.;`

### 2. Database Migrations 
would be applied when you run the application, since the `ASPNETCORE-ENVIRONMENT` is set to `Development`. If you change it, you should apply the migrations yourself.

### 3. Seeding sample data
would happen once you run the application, including Test Accounts:
  - User: user@user.com / password: 12345678
  - Patient: patient@patient.com / password: 12345678
  - Doctor: doctor@doctor.com / password: 12345678
  - Admin: admin@admin.com / password: 12345678
